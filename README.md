# IIIF Audio/Video Player
IIIF A/V Player (WIP)

## Usage
- Clone the repo:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/DDMAL/IIIF-AV-player.git
    ```
- Run `gulp` or `npm start` to build and start the server.
- The server will now be running at `localhost:9001`. 

## Making Changes
If you wish to alter any of the `src` code, make sure to rebundle with `gulp develop:build`. It might be ideal to keep a server running in the background with `gulp develop:server &`, instead of running `gulp` every time.
